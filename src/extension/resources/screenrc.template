# ImmorTerm - Project Screen Configuration

# Disable screen's built-in dynamic title feature (we handle OSC titles via our patch)
# Note: ImmorTerm updates %t directly from OSC 0/2 sequences,
# bypassing this setting. This just disables the AKA escape sequence behavior.
defdynamictitle off

# ImmorTerm branded status bar using hardstatus
# Left: window title | Right: last activity time + ImmorTerm branding
# %I = last I/O activity time (ImmorTerm C code feature - zero polling!)

# ImmorTerm: Scrollback dump on reattach
# DISABLED: The log file approach in screen-auto already handles scrollback
# restoration properly. DumpScrollbackToTerminal captures visual terminal state
# with cursor positioning, which causes garbled output. The log file captures
# the raw byte stream which works correctly.
# Set to "on" to enable screen's internal scrollback dump (not recommended).

# Use shell wrapper that sources shell-init.zsh before starting interactive shell
shell $SCREEN_PROJECT_DIR/.vscode/terminals/shell-wrapper.zsh

# Don't set shelltitle - let screen-auto and extension control the title
# (shelltitle "$WINDOW" would conflict with defdynamictitle)
